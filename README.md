![josemi/icons header](./header.png)

A collection of hand-made and open source SVG icons that you can use in your web projects. Each icon has been designed in a 24x24 grid with a stroke width of 2px and a minimum padding of 2px.

Our icons can be easily integrated in your project just copying the SVG code or using one of our packages.

## Usage

The easiest way is downloading or copying the icons from https://icons.josemi.xyz. Each icon consists in a `<svg>` tag and a single `<path>`.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24">
    <path
        fill="none"
        stroke="currentColor"
        stroke-linecap="round"
        stroke-linejoin="round"
        stroke-width="2"
        d="M...."
    />
</svg>
```

You can also include the icons as images in a `<img>` element using a public CDN:

```html
<img src="https://unpkg.com/@josemi-icons/svg/icons/activity.svg" />
```
